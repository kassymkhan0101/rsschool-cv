My name is Kassymkhan. I graduated this year from Nazarbayev University. My major was Applied Mathematics. 
I studied Machine Learning. I really like coding and want to be a Senior Web Developer in next 5 years. I took several courses from Coursera, Stepik, Udemy and Harvard. 
Now, I work as a Software Developer at Cube company. We develop our ERP system by adding new features.
